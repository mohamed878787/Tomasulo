#Tomasulo's Algorithm

Tomasulo's Algorithm is a dynamic scheduling algorithm used in computer architecture to achieve parallelism in instruction execution. It's particularly popular in superscalar processors and is effective in executing instructions with dependencies by allowing them to execute out of order. This GitHub repository provides an implementation of Tomasulo's Algorithm in [language], demonstrating its functionality and potential applications in modern processor design.

Features:
Dynamic Scheduling: Instructions are dynamically scheduled for execution, allowing for out-of-order execution and efficient resource utilization.
Reservation Stations: The algorithm utilizes reservation stations to buffer instructions and manage dependencies, facilitating parallel execution.
Register Renaming: Register renaming is employed to eliminate false dependencies and increase instruction-level parallelism.
Reorder Buffer: A reorder buffer is implemented to maintain program order, ensuring correct instruction retirement while allowing for out-of-order execution.
Simulation Environment: Provides a simulation environment to visualize the execution of instructions and analyze performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and resource utilization.
